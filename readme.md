INTRODUSION

It is a pretty simple version of my filter. I started work on it with creating method's like "Check for common spammers pattern",
contains "Number of words with no vowels", "Number of words with at least two of letters J, K, Q, X, Z", "Number of words with at least 15 characters",
"Binary feature indicating whether the strings “From:” and “To:” were both present", e.t.c
(Based on this work http://stat.wvu.edu/~dluo/CS791A/project_proposal.pdf).
But when I writed it and check on training data set(461:SPAM, 153:HAM), all patterns triggered without any depending to human eyes.
I visualized proportion words without vowels in spam and ham (http://goo.gl/ESQ6n) X (http://goo.gl/FKXHq), and its seems like neutral network needed
to create working filter based on pattern like this. Dead end for me. 


DESCRIPTION

Filter already trained on data sets, have dicts with spamers and hamers list, and list of spam/ham email subjects. Dict's summ all trainigs.
Filter already trained on data sets with Bayesian algorithm. Dicts sum only my big training
When filter test data: then check first black list of spamers, white list of hamers, then subject spam/ham lists and then, if it is all new
email message, start Bayesian algorithm.

TO DO

Write some algorithm to make work check_common_spamers_pattern module (https://github.com/il-vladislav/SpamFilter/blob/master/common_spamers_pattern.py)
Try to ignore HTML code, when using Bayesian algorithm.
There is much thing to do, Machine Learning never stop...
